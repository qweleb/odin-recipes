    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil (2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Large Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic Cloves, finely chopped (4)</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika (1 tsp)</li>
        <li>Ground Cumin (1 tsp)</li>
        <li>Chipotle Chilli Paste</li>
        <li>Chopped Tomatoes or Passata (200g)</li>
        <li>Beans (800g)</li>
        <li>Crusty Bread Slices (4-8)</li>
        <li>Grated Cheddar (150g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 8-10 mins until softened and slightly caramelised. Add the garlic and spices, the chipotle chilli paste or chilli flakes, if using, and some seasoning. Fry for a few minutes more until the mixture is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, then swirl out the pan using 100ml water and add this too. Simmer for 10-15 mins until the mixture has thickened. Blitz the sauce using a hand blender, then taste for seasoning. Tip in the beans and mix well to coat. Warm through over a medium heat for 5 mins until the beans are piping hot.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to high and toast the bread slices for 3-5 mins. Top with the beans and grated cheese, and pop under the grill until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Sprinkle with a little paprika and serve immediately.</li>
