        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti 200g</li>
            <li>Guanciale 200g</li>
            <li>Garlic Cloves (3)</li>
            <li>Free Range Eggs (3)</li>
            <li>Crushed Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano (200g)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add your Spaghetti. Get a timer going for 9 minutes</li>
            <li>Put a frying pan on the stove, put in your diced guanciale, 3 crushed gloves of garlic and a pinch of black pepper and turn the stove to HOT.</li>
            <li>Whilst the pasta and meat is cooking, beat together one whole egg, and two egg yolks, with grated Pecorino Romano and a generous helping of black pepper.</li>
            <li>When your pasta timer goes off, your guanciale should be nice and crispy. Turn the heat off, remove the garlic cloves and transfer the spaghetti using a pair of tongs into the frying pan and move it quickly. Make sure to get some pasta water in with meat, as the rendered fat will combine with the starchy pasta water to make a thick, creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>The residual heat from the pan will be enough to keep the pasta hot, when fat emsulfies, tip the contents of the pan into the bowl of egg mixture and mix thoroughly. If the sauce is too dry and a bit more pasta water.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
