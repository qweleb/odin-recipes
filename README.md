# Qweleb's Recipe Project (The Odin Project)

I have created my repository on GitHub, and cloned the project into my /repos directory.

This project is about creating a website to showcase recipes, using my knowledge of html boilerplating, headings, body, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, creating links and images.

I have successfully created an index page, which links to three recipe pages on my website: Carbonara, Brownies and Beans on Toast.

Each recipe page has correctly formatted titles, descriptions, an image, and recipe instructions.
